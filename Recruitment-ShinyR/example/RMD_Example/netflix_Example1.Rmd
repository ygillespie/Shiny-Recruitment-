## we are going to review 3 major points of the Netflix data. 

Data: https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows 

we are going to review the top 10 genres, directors, actors, and countries. these will be displayed in the form of figures below.

## Genre

we can see that from the 10 genres, the most populated is international. this is consistent with both movie and TV.
```{r genre, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
 #removes the white space btw. the listed genres.
   netflix$listed_in=trimws(netflix$listed_in,which='left')
        
 #seperate the genres and summarize their counts. 
 top_genres=netflix %>% 
   #seperate the genres in nested formate.
     mutate(genre=strsplit(listed_in,',')) %>%   
   #unnest the new column(genre), meaning that new duplciate rows are created.
     unnest(genre) %>%       
   #group by type and genre.
     group_by(type,genre) %>%        
   #summarize the count of genre and types.
     summarise(count=n()) %>%        
   #count only unique operations since some objects might.
     unique() %>%     
   #arrange makes a change in how the data is displayed(now desending order).
     arrange(desc(count)) %>%
   #limits the number of variables displayed to set value.
     top_n(10,count)
    
 #create the graph using ggplot2
top_genres %>% ggplot(aes(x= fct_reorder(genre,count,.desc = T),y=count,fill=type))+
            geom_col()+
            scale_y_continuous(limits =c(0,1850),breaks =seq(0,1850,400))+
            labs(title='Top Genres - Movies Vs Tv Shows',x='Genres') +
            theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```


## Actors and Directors

here we can see that the top actors and directors in terms of how many films or shows they've been in/directed. 
```{r actors and Directors, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#organizing a new dataframe for actors and directors 
Actors=netflix %>%
    select(director,cast)%>%
#turning the cast and director columns into a key value system
    gather(key="cast_dir",value="person",director,cast)%>%      
#remove the missing values that are empty.
    filter(person!="")%>%       
#seperate the list of names into their own row.
    separate_rows(person, sep=",")      

Actors$actor=trimws(Actors$person, which = "left")      
#remove the white space from the right side of the names, a result of the seperate_rows.

Actor_freq=Actors %>%
#defining the grouping variables that will be summarized 
    group_by(cast_dir,person)%>%        
#summarize the number of unique pairs 
    summarise(count=n())%>%         
#arrange the summarized table in decending order(highest to lowest)
    arrange(desc(count))%>%         
#limit the number of observations to 10
    top_n(10,count)         

#creating the figure
Actor_freq %>% ggplot(aes(x=fct_reorder(person,count,.desc = T),y=count,fill=cast_dir))+
            geom_col()+
            facet_wrap(~cast_dir,scales = 'free_x')+
            scale_x_discrete()+
            labs(title='Top Actors & Directors',x='Actors & Directors')+
            theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))

```

## Country

Here we can see what countries have the most films/shows are produced. 

```{r country, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# creating a new dataframe including type and country.
uniqueEntries <- netflix %>%
    select(type,country)%>%
  #seperate the list of countries per variable.
    separate_rows(country, sep = ",")

#remove the white space on the left of the new country variable. 
uniqueEntries$country <- trimws(uniqueEntries$country, which = "left")

#work the data before creating the figure.
uniqueEntries <- uniqueEntries%>%
  #remove empty/missing data.
    filter(country!="")%>%
    group_by(type, country) %>%
    summarise(count=n())%>%
    arrange(desc(count))%>%
    top_n(10,count)

#create the figure
uniqueEntries %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=fct_reorder(country,count,.desc = T), y=count,fill=type))+
    geom_col()+
    facet_wrap(~type,scales = 'free_x')+
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+
    scale_x_discrete()+
    labs(title='Top Countries for Movies Vs Tv',x='Country')+
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```


## Discussion:

We can compare the use of rmd to review data with shinyR. The example provided uses the same code to construct and organize the data as the ShinyR counterpart. The major difference in that we can not interact with the figures like in shiny. This is a major draw back for base markdown because this means all reports are static.

Now markdown does have it's advantages, primarily that it works in chunks. When you review the raw code you can follow along and run each section independently to check if they're working as intended. This makes markdown an effective method to start coding in R.
